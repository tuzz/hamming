## Hamming Distance

A very quick Sentient program to find N 6-bit strings with a hamming distance of
three or greater. This is a follow-up to a London Computation Club meeting from
Tuesday 3rd May, 2016.

Currently, the program is very repetitious as Sentient doesn't have functions
yet. This will change soon.

## How to run

```
npm install -g sentient-lang
sentient hamming8.snt
```

If [lingeling](http://fmv.jku.at/lingeling/) is on your path, this will be faster:

```
sentient -a lingeling hamming8.snt
```
