## Hamming Distance

A very quick Sentient program to find N 6-bit strings with a hamming distance of
three or greater. This is a follow-up to a London Computation Club meeting from
Tuesday 3rd May, 2016.

## How to run

Add [lingeling](http://fmv.jku.at/lingeling/) to your path, then:

```
npm install -g sentient-lang
sentient hamming.snt -a lingeling
```
